## Code Example

The notification component is a component that inserts a banner at the top of the page for showing user-dismissible alerts and messages. Its contents will be removed when the banner is closed. You have control over the message contents including the option for a link. The message is triggered by selecting the parent content (usually `<body>`) and executing the `notification()` function with various options to create the notification banner.

```javascript
  $('body').notification({
    type: 'info',
    message: 'DTO rejected by your manager for Sept 30, 2018.',
    link: '#',
    linkText: 'Click to view'
  });
```

## Accessibility

- TODO: We should add aria-alerts similar to the way toast works.
