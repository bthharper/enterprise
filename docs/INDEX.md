## Getting Started

To install the enterprise components into your project using NPM, run the following:

```sh
npm install --save ids-enterprise
```

The files will then be found in `/node_modules/ids-enterprise/dist`.

To install the code for development using `git`, run:

```sh
mkdir enterprise
cd enterprise
git clone https://github.com/infor-design/enterprise.git .
```

Then you just need to install, build, and serve the demo app up.

```sh
npm install
npx grunt
npm start
```
